# Instructions
``` const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"]; ```


## Part I - Review About Arrays


1. Write code to remove “Greg” from the `people` array.

2. Write code to replace “James” to “Jason”.

3. Write code to add your name to the end of the `people` array.

4. Write code that console.logs Mary’s index. `take a look at the indexOf method on Google`.

5. Write code to make a copy of the `people` array using the `slice` method.
    - The copy should NOT include “Mary” or your name.
    - **Hint**: remember that now the `people` array should look like this `const people = ["Mary", "Devon", "Jason", "Yourname"]`;
    - **Hint**: Check out the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)  for the `slice` method

6. Write code that gives the index of “Foo”. `Why does it return -1 ?`

7. Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
   **Hint**: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the length of the array?


## Part II - Loops

1. Using a loop, iterate through the `people` array and console.log each person.

2. Using a loop, iterate through the people array and exit the loop after you console.log “Jason” .
   **Hint**: take a look at the `break` statement in the lesson.
